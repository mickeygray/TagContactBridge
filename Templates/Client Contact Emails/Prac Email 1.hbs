    <p>Hi {{name}},</p>

    <p>
      Thanks for taking the first stepâ€”now letâ€™s take the one that starts
      clearing the path forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      On this call, weâ€™ll contact the taxing authority together. Youâ€™ll hear
      exactly whatâ€™s on file: balances, missing returns, flagsâ€”whatever is
      affecting your case. This isnâ€™t guesswork. Itâ€™s a fact-finding mission
      that saves you hours of hold time and confusion.
    </p>

    <p>
      This call lays the foundation for everything weâ€™ll do from here. Itâ€™s
      simple, itâ€™s fast, and itâ€™s how we move with confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's get started today! Call me directly at
