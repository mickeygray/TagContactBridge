          <p>Congratulations—after reviewing your case, we believe you may
            qualify for penalty and interest abatement. This could lead to a
            substantial reduction in your overall tax liability.</p>
          <p>But this opportunity comes with some responsibilities.</p>
          <p>We will represent you at an upcoming hearing. Though you do not
            need to be present, the IRS will expect detailed information about
            the years in which you were delinquent or underpaid. There are
            specific circumstances the IRS considers:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Medical issues</li>
            <li>Loss of income or employment</li>
            <li>Family hardship</li>
            <li>Natural disasters or major life disruptions</li>
            <li>Other reasonable causes beyond your control</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To confirm that these apply to you, you’ll need to provide
            documentation—anything that helps tell your story: bills, notices,
            medical records, or other supporting materials.</p>
