          <p>Your Power of Attorney has been filed, which means we’re officially
            representing you. We can now speak directly to the IRS, request your
            transcripts, intervene with enforcement where possible, and begin
            taking action to protect your assets and resolve your case.</p>
          <p>Before the IRS considers any relief, they need a full picture of
            your finances—that's gathered through Form 433a (the Collection
            Information Statement). We'll simplify this process with a
            one-on-one call. A specialist will walk you through the form,
            explain what's important, and gather everything we need to move your
            case forward. You won't have to handle any paperwork alone.</p>
