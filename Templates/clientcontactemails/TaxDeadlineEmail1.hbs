          <p>We’ve been reviewing information from all of our clients to prepare
            for this tax season, and we want to make sure we understand your
            plan.</p>
          <p>If you’re filing with us, we need to speak with you right away. If
            you’re using another preparer, please send us a copy of your return
            as soon as it’s filed. And if you think you may need an extension,
            do not wait—let us know now so we can help you avoid problems.</p>
          <p>Please don’t delay. This year’s return plays a key role in how we
            manage your case and protect your assets. We are deeply invested in
            your outcome, and that means we need to talk to you about this
            year’s filings.</p>
