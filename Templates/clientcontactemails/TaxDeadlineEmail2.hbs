          <p>This week is your last opportunity to schedule an appointment to
            file your taxes with us.</p>
          <p>After this week, if we haven’t heard from you, we’ll need to
            discuss an extension before we can move forward. We’re processing
            returns and extension requests for thousands of clients, and once
            this week ends, we have to prioritize those who are ready.</p>
          <p>If you’re expecting a balance, we need to know immediately. And if
            something’s come up that makes it hard for you to file on time, it
            takes just five minutes to let us know so we can get your extension
            in.</p>
          <p><strong>This is not optional.</strong>
            Filing your taxes on time is the law, and missing the deadline could
            cause serious problems for your case.</p>
          <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Call us at
