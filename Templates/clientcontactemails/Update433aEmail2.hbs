          <p>The IRS Form 433a is essential to resolving your case and
            protecting your assets—it's how we demonstrate that you can't afford
            to pay the IRS on their terms. Some of the details you may want to
            review include your income and expenses, personal or household
            assets such as vehicles and bank accounts, and your current job or
            business activities.</p>
          <p>If your financial situation hasn’t changed much, consider this a
            quick check-in. We’ll compare your original form to your current
            situation, confirm the details, and update anything necessary. It'll
            be a brief call—but critical, because accuracy here makes all the
            difference.</p>
