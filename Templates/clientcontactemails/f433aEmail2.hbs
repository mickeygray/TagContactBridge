          <p>The IRS Form 433a is essential to resolving your case and
            protecting your assetsâ€”it's how we demonstrate your financial
            situation and determine what kind of relief you may qualify for. You
            might want to start gathering details such as your income and
            expenses, personal or household assets (like vehicles and bank
            accounts), and your current employment or business information.</p>
          <p>We understand this process can feel overwhelming, which is exactly
            why we won't ask you to do it alone. We'll schedule a one-on-one
            call, and a specialist will guide you step by step. You'll
            understand exactly what matters, and we'll ensure we collect all
            necessary information to advance your case.</p>
