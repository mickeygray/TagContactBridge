  <p>Hi {{name}},</p>

  <p>New tax law changes will impact how income is classified, how deductions
    are applied, and how audits are triggered, especially for business owners,
    sole proprietors, and individuals with outstanding tax issues.</p>

  <p>For sole proprietors and LLCs, new limitations on deductions and increased
    scrutiny on filings are shifting the risk profile. Structures that may have
    been tax-efficient just one year ago can now result in inflated liability or
    heightened audit risk. Income classification and payment timing must be
    reassessed to remain compliant under the revised system.</p>

  <p>For individuals, the cost of delay is not only a growing liability—it’s a
    missed opportunity to future-proof yourself. Especially for those with
    unresolved tax years, missed quarterlies, or estimated payments, lingering
    balances can block access to new credits and deductions.</p>

  <p>Many provisions and rate reductions are set to expire. If no action is
    taken, exposure increases and options narrow. We’ve been adjusting business
    structures, reviewing prior filings, and helping our clients take preventive
    steps to avoid overpaying taxes.</p>
